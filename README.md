## Kuesuto

**Kuesuto** is a gamified productivity platform that transforms everyday tasks into epic quests. Built for people who want more than a boring to-do list, Kuesuto turns goal-setting into an RPG-style adventure where progress feels rewarding, motivating, and fun.

Instead of checking off lifeless tasks, users create **quests**, complete **missions**, earn **points**, and **level up** as they work toward their goals. Whether you’re planning personal growth, managing projects, or building better habits, Kuesuto makes productivity feel like a game worth playing.

At its core, Kuesuto blends **smart tracking**, **AI-powered guidance**, and a **futuristic space-themed interface** to keep users engaged and consistent. A built-in AI quest assistant provides insights, motivation, and progress awareness, helping users stay on track and adapt their strategy as they advance.

Kuesuto is designed to make achievement feel exciting—not exhausting.

## Our Story

Many productivity tools focus on tasks but fail to keep users motivated. Over time, goals feel repetitive and progress becomes hard to notice.

Kuesuto was built to change that. Inspired by RPG mechanics, it turns goal-setting into a quest-based experience where every task contributes to progression and achievement.
