At its core, Kuesuto blends **smart tracking**, **AI-powered guidance**, and a **futuristic space-themed interface** to keep users engaged and consistent.

## Background

Many productivity tools focus on tasks but fail to keep users motivated. Over time, goals feel repetitive and progress becomes hard to notice.

Kuesuto was built to change that. Inspired by RPG mechanics, it turns goal-setting into a quest-based experience where every task contributes to progression and achievement.
